\title{restrict a landmark config or mesh to probabilistic bounds from a sample of landmarks/vertices}
\usage{
restrict(
  x,
  model,
  sd = 3,
  maxVar = 95,
  scale = FALSE,
  nPC = NULL,
  probab = FALSE,
  reference = NULL
)

\method{restrict}{mesh3d}(
  x,
  model,
  sd = 3,
  maxVar = 95,
  scale = FALSE,
  nPC = NULL,
  probab = FALSE,
  reference = NULL
)

\method{restrict}{matrix}(
  x,
  model,
  sd = 3,
  maxVar = 95,
  scale = FALSE,
  nPC = NULL,
  probab = FALSE,
  reference = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{matrix or triangular mesh of class "mesh3d"}

\item{model}{object of class "nosymproc" (output from \code{\link{procSym}} run on a set of corresponding landmarks/vertices), serving as a priori knowledge about vertex/landmark distribution.}

\item{sd}{standard deviation of PCscores defining boundaries}

\item{maxVar}{percentage to be explained by the PCs used for the restriction. E.g. if you want to include PCs explaining 95\% of the variance, set maxVar=95.}

\item{scale}{logical: if FALSE, configuration will be restricted within a probablistic hypercube, otherwise Chi-Square distribution will be used.}

\item{nPC}{number of PCs used in restricting (overrides maxVar)}

\item{probab}{if TRUE only the probability will be returned.}

\item{reference}{integer vector specifiying those landmarks that should be set to meanshape}
}
