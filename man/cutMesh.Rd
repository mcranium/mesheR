\title{crop triangular surface meshes}
\usage{
cutMesh(
  mesh,
  visible = TRUE,
  keep.selected = TRUE,
  col = 3,
  add = FALSE,
  render = c("shade", "wire"),
  offset = 0.001,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mesh}{triangular mesh of class "mesh3d"}

\item{visible}{select only vertices visible (from the present point of view)}

\item{keep.selected}{logical: determines if the selected vertices or their
complement are deleted.}

\item{col}{color to render the mesh.}

\item{add}{logical: add the surface to an existing window.}

\item{render}{character: how to render the surface. Possible values are
"shade" or "wire".}

\item{offset}{initial offset to move vertex slightly away from the surface. 1e-3 seems to be a good threshold for objects from the macroscopical world.}

\item{\dots}{additional arguments passed to the rendering functions
shade3d and wire3d from package "rgl".}
}
\value{
selectVertex returns the indices of the selected vertices.

cutMesh returns the trimmed mesh.
}
\description{
crop a surface mesh interactively.
}
\details{
select vertices or trim a triangular mesh by selecting a subset - either
restricted to visible from the current point of view or by rectangular
region. Visibility is determined by the fact that the vector from the
viewpoint to the selected vertex does not intersect the mesh.
